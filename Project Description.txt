About the Project
This is a simple digital wallet program that works like a mini Paytm or 
Google Pay. Two users can create their own wallets and perform daily 
money transactions such as:

• Add Money (Deposit)
• Withdraw Money
• Send Money to another person
• Check Current Balance
• View Complete Transaction History

Special Features
• Every transaction gets a unique TX-ID (using uuid)
• Date & time is recorded automatically
• Shows clear messages like "Sent to Rahul" or "Received from Priya"
• Balance is updated instantly and safely

How It Works
1. Enter names for two wallets (e.g., Amit & Neha)
2. Choose options from a menu (1 to 6)
3. Perform transactions easily
